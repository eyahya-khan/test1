	                <h2>Tale of the Rose</h2>
	                In the spring of 1944, Antoine de Saint-Exupery left his wife, Consuelo, to return to the war in Europe. Soon after, he disappeared while flying a reconnaissance mission over occupied France. Neither his plane nor his body was ever found. The Tale of the Rose is Consuelo's account of their extraordinary marriage. It is a love story about a pilot and his wife, a man who yearned for the stars and the spirited woman who gave him the strength to fulfill his dreams.<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/39748/the-tale-of-the-rose-by-consuelo-de-saint-exupery/" target="_blank" title="ABBA">read more...</a>
